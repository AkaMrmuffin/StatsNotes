3.Dispersion: 

  5 number summary: Quartiles( 1 , median, 3) min and max -> plot boxplot show the dispersion of data
    Q3 - Q1 = Interquartile Range 

  Others: Percential and Decile 

  Standard Deviation (s): represents how far on anverage observations in a variable are from mean
  Variance (S^2): we can not directly compare STD DEV of 2 variables that have different mean 

  Coefficient of Variabce: CV = STD/Mean

4. Histogram and Normal Curve: 

  Histogram represents the probability distribution of a continuous variable. 
  
  Normal Curve represents the model (model is the simplification of reality) of that histogram.
  
  a. Draw Back of the histogram:
      
      - Bin widths are arbitray, different bin width can change the characteristics of the histogram
      - Histogram degrade data from ratio data to the ordinal data
      
  b. Charactoristics of the Normal Distribution: 
  
      - Large sample size (# of observation) 
      - Observations are completely independent of each other.
      - Each individual observation is determined by random chance. 
      
  c. Moments of the mean 
      - 1st moment: mean 
      - 2nd moment: Variance 
      - 3rd moment: Skewness 
      - 4th moment: Kurtosis
      
  d. 99.7% data are in +- 2.5 STD DEV
