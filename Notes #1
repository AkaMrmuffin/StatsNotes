3.Dispersion: 

  5 number summary: Quartiles( 1 , median, 3) min and max -> plot boxplot show the dispersion of data
    Q3 - Q1 = Interquartile Range 

  Others: Percential and Decile 

  Standard Deviation (s): represents how far on anverage observations in a variable are from mean
  Variance (S^2): we can not directly compare STD DEV of 2 variables that have different mean 

  Coefficient of Variabce: CV = STD/Mean

4. Histogram and Normal Curve: 

  Histogram represents the probability distribution of a continuous variable. 
  
  Normal Curve represents the model (model is the simplification of reality) of that histogram.
  
  a. Draw Back of the histogram:
      
      - Bin widths are arbitray, different bin width can change the characteristics of the histogram
      - Histogram degrade data from ratio data to the ordinal data
      
  b. Charactoristics of the Normal Distribution: 
  
      - Large sample size (# of observation) 
      - Observations are completely independent of each other.
      - Each individual observation is determined by random chance. 
      
  c. Moments of the mean 
      - 1st moment: mean 
      - 2nd moment: Variance 
      - 3rd moment: Skewness 
      - 4th moment: Kurtosis
      
  d. 99.7% data are in +- 2.5 STD DEV  
  
5. Correlation 
   
   2 variables are related -> 1 variable can give the imformation of another variable 
   
   a. Qualitative v.s. Qualitative 
      Factor Plot 
      
   b. Quantitative v.s. Qualitative 
      Histogram 
   
   c. Quantitaive v.s. Quantitative 
      Scatter Plot 
        -> Calculate the correlation of covariance and Pearson's r to determine the relationship 
        -> Pearson's R (-1 to 1) 
            - r = 1 means the strong positive relationship 
            - r =-1 means the strong negative relationship 
            - r = 0 means the no relationship 

6. Regression 

   Y and X-> y = ax + b 
   
   'Line of Best Fit': minimize the sum of error s behind the observed y value and the y value predicted by the line 
   
   There are many different fitting method (Polynomial, Log ...) 
   
   a. Goodness of Fit r^2: (0-1)
      - coefficient of determination
      - low r^2 represents poor fit 
      - high r^2 represents good fit 
      - limitation: r^2 can be high for non-casuel 
                    r^ can be low when theory says strong relationship 
      - give you better idear about strenghth of relationship of 2 variables 
      
   b. Standard Error of Estimates: S
      - RMSE
