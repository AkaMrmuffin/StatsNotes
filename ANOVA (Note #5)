ANOVA - Analysis of Variance 

Part I 

Key Point: Analysis the difference of means for 2 or more sample groups 

e.g. 3 "treatments" at the park grass experiment 
      
     3 groups, each with 6 samples 
     
     Treatment      A     B     C
     sample means   Y1    Y2    Y3
     H0:    Y1 = Y2 = Y3
     HA:    At least one mean (Y) differs from others 
     
   sample variance  S1    S2    S3
   
   Calculate 1. Mean of means Y1+Y2+Y3/ 3 
   
             2. Variance of means 
             
             3. Pop variance / pooled variance = samples (# of treatment) * vaiance of means 
             
             4. F-test with F = ((# of treatment) * variance of means) / pop variance 
                                            df: # treatment - 1           df: (# of obs -1) * treatments 
                                            
                               H0: F <= 1 
                               HA: F > 1 
                               
  Part II 
  pairwise testing 
  
  1. least significant difference test 
  2. tukeys's honest significant difference test 
  3. Scheffe's Contrast Method -> Most flexible one 
  
  H0: Y1 = Y2 or Y3 = Y2 or Y3 = Y1 
  
  HA: Y1 != Y2 or Y3 != Y2 or Y3 != Y1 
  
  contrast: L = Y1*C1 + Y2*C2
            C1 = 1     C2 = -1 
            
  L - S*a <= L0 <= L+ S*a 
  
  L -> contrast 
  S -> A score that dependes on our confidence level 
  a -> An estimate of the standard deviation of the "L" statistics 
  
  ANOVA is a parametric test: it can tolerate a small amount of non-normlity or heteroscedasticity
