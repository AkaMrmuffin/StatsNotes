Inferential Statistics (Draw a Conclusion about population by using samples)

Part I
The basic idea is to use the point estimator to generate the infos about population. 
    usually we have 
                    Z = (sample mean - pop mean)/ pop standard deviation 
                    
                    then we can calcualate the dimensionless variable occuring probability by using P(z) equatuion or table 
                    
Point Estimation
    - A Simple Number is calculated from the sample, and which can be used to best estimates of some unkonwn population parameter.
    
    
    When Slecting Estimator
         2 Elements (Bias and Efficiency) 
         - Bias high: Sample Value > Pop Stat
           Bias low: Sample Value < Pop Stat
           
         - Efficiency high: low Variance 
           Efficiency low: High Variance 
 
 Part II
 1. A Confidence Interval presents a range of values with a specified probability that the population statistics lies 
    with those value. 
    
    95% confidence interval (Standard)
      
      Sample STD DEV = (POP STD DEV)/ (Square Root of Sample Size)
      
      The idea is to calculat the range of confidence interval for Pop Mean
     
      a. z-score      
      P (sample mean - 1.96*sample STD <= Pop Mean <= sample mean + 1.96*sample STD) = 0.95 
      
            1.96 is Z score 
            
      b. Student t-score
      P(sample mean - t-score * (Sample STD/Square Root of Sample Size) <= Pop Mean <= sample mean + t-score * (Sample STD/Square Root of Sample Size)) = 0.95 
          
          We use studnet t only when x is normal 
          - 2 tailed 0.95 
          - 1 tailed 0.0.25
          
      c. Suitable Sample Size 
         - can be calculated based on the Z-score, Pop STD , and Pop mean precision 
         
         - n = ((Z-score * Pop STD)/(Pop-mean Precision))^2
    
    Part III
    
    1. Binomial Varibale - result of random process 
       a. (pi) is probability of certain outcome ocuuring (Pop Mean)
       b. draw a smaple from the population, we can calculate the sample probability P
       c. Sample probability (P) is normally distributted around (pi) with 
              Pop STD = root square((pi*(1-pi))/sample size(n)) 
       d. follows C.L.T
       
    2. 6-Steps of Hypothesis Test
       
       a. Formulation of Hypothsis
          Null Hypothesis and Alternate Hypothesis 
          usually reject H0
          
       b. Specification of Sample Statistics and its Sampling Distribution 
          Point Estimator 
          Normal Distribution 
          
       c. Selection of a level of significance
          significant level: a 
          confidence level: 1-a 
          
       d. Construction of Decision Rule 
          2-tail or 1-tail
          not same -> 2 tail 
          larger or smaller -> 1 tail 
          
       e. Compute the value of test statistics
          Calculate the Sample Probability (P)
          
       f. Decision 
          Checking against the critical value, if critical value is 0.073 
          P > 0.073 if P = 0.08
          H0 = pi <= 0.04
          HA = pi >= 0.04
          
          0.08 > 0.04 
          
          we reject H0 and accept HA
    
    Part IV (P-Value)
    1. P-Value Based Hypothesis Test
       
       All same until compute the value of test statistics (Step 5)
       
       calculate the Z-score:
       
       Z = (PoP probability - hypothesis probability)/PoP standard Deviation 
       
    2. Limitation of P-value: 
      
       a. Designed as quick way to check whether the result was signifiacnt enough to warrant further attension 
       b. It's not telling you HA is true, its jest telling you how much probability that your H0 is sampling error
       c. P-value is vulnerable, easy to be mannuly manipulated 
       d. Statical signifaicant != useful
